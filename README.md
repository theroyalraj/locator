# Spring Boot Locator Backend API

This project is a Spring Boot-based backend server that serves geolocation data for food trucks. It uses **Elasticsearch** for geo-location and full text based searches.

## Project Overview

The backend API is responsible for providing geolocation-based search services using **Elasticsearch** as the database. The API allows users to search for food trucks based on latitude and longitude coordinates. The application is deployed using Docker and the backend is hosted at:

## Elasticsearch Database

The project uses **Elasticsearch** as the geo-location database for storing and querying coordinates. It is hosted on the **Elast.co Free Tier**, which allows us to perform efficient searches for locations based on geospatial data.


### Elasticsearch Query Example

An example query for finding nearby food trucks based on coordinates looks like this:

```json
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "multi_match": {
            "query": "your_search_term",
            "fields": [
              "locationDesc",
              "name",
              "permit",
              "description",
              "applicant",
              "optionalText"
            ]
          }
        },
        {
          "term": {
            "dayOrder": {
              "value": "your_day_order_value"
            }
          }
        }
      ],
      "filter": [
        {
          "geo_distance": {
            "distance": "10km",
            "coordinates": {
              "lat": 40.730610,
              "lon": -73.935242
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "sort": [
    {
      "_geo_distance": {
        "coordinates": {
          "lat": 40.730610,
          "lon": -73.935242
        },
        "order": "asc",
        "unit": "km"
      }
    }
  ],
  "from": 0,  // Your offset
  "size": 10  // Your limit
}

```

## Getting Started

### Requirements

To run this project locally or deploy it, you will need the following:

- **Java 21+**: Ensure you have JDK 21 or higher installed on your machine.
- **Docker**: To containerize and deploy the application easily.

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/theroyalraj/locator.git
cd locator
```


2. **Build the project**:
> ./mvnw clean install

3. **Run the application**:
> ./mvnw spring-boot:run


4. **Access the application**:
API: http://localhost:8080
Swagger UI: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html


## Deployement
